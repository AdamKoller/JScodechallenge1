    <h3>Code Challenge 1</h3>
    <!--
    Adam went to three different restuarants. The bills
    were $104,$57, and $228. He decides the tip under 3 conditions:
      - 20% if bill is less than $50
      - 15% if bill is between $50-$200
      - 10% if bill is greater than $200

    Create:
    1) an array with all three tip values for the given bill
    2) an array with all three FINAL amounts(bill+tip)
